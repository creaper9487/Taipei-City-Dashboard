- 使用情境：
    - 提供一個能夠讓儀表板推廣給更多人的貢獻方式（而且不一定要會寫程式！）

- 操作方式：
    - 儀表板網站
        - 進入網站，在地球儀 icon 選單中可切換語言。
    - Crowdin
        - 可從 Dashboard 中加入協作。
### 使用資源
- 企業資源：
    Crowdin，一個提供翻譯平台的工具，具自動 push 翻譯到存放庫的功能。
- 公開資源：
    Vue-i18n <br>此工具用於將翻譯過的字串套用在網頁上

### 你還想分享的事情
- 開發過程&心得
  - 聽起來還好的功能卻要花很多時間做
  - 一次學了 vue, crowdin, go, docker 和好多有趣的東西，是我第一個沒放棄的專案
  - 桃園也需要這個酷咚咚，台北的學生作自主學習有這個好幸福。
- 遇到的困難
  - 如上所述，學習成本不小，但一點一點摸索出來的感覺很讓人上癮。
  - 我們隊友不見了@@
